#### What is Pinyin ?

Pinyin is the Chinese phonetic system which comprise by English letters.

For instance, the Pinyin of `天` is `tiān`;

However, in this game, let's ignore the tone symble on top of `tiān`; which means you can score with type in `tian`;

#### How to Play

There are 2 players in this game.

`The test taker` is the one who will take the test with this website.

`The helper` is the one who will find out the answer and tell the test taker.

To score, the test taker must type-in the correct Pinyin of the shown Chinese character. 

In order to do so, `the test taker` must make a phone call to tell `the helper` how the Chinese character looks like, so the helper can find out the Pinyin of the character by a hand writing dictionary.

#### Step by Step

1. `The test taker` visits this website, and sees a Chinese Character on this website.
2. `The helper` grabs a phone in hand, launches Google Translate app and switches the keyboard to Chinese Hand Writing input.
3. `The test taker` describes how the Chinese Character looks like verbally.
4. `The helper` tries to input the Character in Google by hand writing.
5. Once inputed, Google will tell the Pinyin of the character `like we said, ignore the tone symble`.
6. `The test taker` types in the Pinyin, and scores.
